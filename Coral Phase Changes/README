The aim of this project was to try and recreate the process, result and recovery of a coral bleaching event using a lattice
based 'Potts' model. Each coral site has three possible states: healthy, bleached and dead. From here we can set the
probabilities of state altering processes: coral recovery, death, coral spread. The probabilities of each of these is dependent
both on the water surface temp, and the health of its' neighbours.
From here we can run the simulation very similarly to any Potts or Ising model. To recreate the observed phenomenon of coral 
bleaching events I used Sci-kit learn to optimise simulation parameters. These being effect and recovery from 'degree Heating days' (days spent over
the coral health treshold temp), nearest neighbour coupling, and a few more. We very lightly incorporate the nearest neighbour effects
from magnetic systems. 
The basis of a Potts model is a lattice set up, where each site is initialised with a state, then depending on external facotrs and
local factors a Monte Carlo process is run on a distribution exp(A*t), where 't' typically temperature in a physics situation. 
The reference data Sci-kit learn attempts to mimic is from Scotts Reef in Western Australia, the qulaity of coral bleaching % data
was very poor. I would love to continue the project with more practice in machine learning, as well as finding some more detailed
data. 
The results are in the graphs below. The system seems to lag behind the training data, not wanting to bleach or recovery as readily
maybe I over estimated the spacial component of a bleaching event. Was still an interesting exercise. Maybe one bettwe suited to vegiation
rather than coral.
