Sample of coding projects I have undertaken through college or in my own time.
Most of which are physical simulations in Python and some practical numerical simulations in C++, but I am hoping to complete some more personal projects shortly :)
During my theoretical physics course, the coding projects were mainly focused on numerical solutions to various physics-related systems, quantum wells, etc.
Going forward, I am more interested in pursuing applied mathematics more generally, especially mathematical ecology and complex systems. I have started this journey from a very physics point of view, currently working through (very slowly) the books: "Introduction to Econophysics: Contemporary Approaches with Python Simulations" by C. R. da Cunha. And "Critical Transitions in Nature and Society" by Martin Scheffer.
