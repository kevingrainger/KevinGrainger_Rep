This work was done as part of a final prjoect in my fourth year module, Practical Numerical simulations. I really really enjoyed
this module, and these programs proved so useful for other simulations. I know there are premade PDE solving tools. 
We applied them to some commonly encountered PDE systems; Heat dissapation, Schrodinger Eq, and Black Scholes equation. 
The 3D graphing and parameter relation graphs are a bit unneeded but look really nice.
