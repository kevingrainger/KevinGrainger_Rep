This was my first stab at an SIR model , it is not full complete. 
It was a recreation of the results from the paper :A lattice model to manage the vector and the infection of the Xylella fastidiosa on olive trees by
Annalisa Fierro, Antonella Liccardo & Francesco Porcelli.
I found the Olive rapid decline issue really interesting, lots of research has been done in the southern Italian universities. 
The paper also tested the effect of preventive measures, I only simulated the unaltered closed Olive grove system. 
The processes were purely stochastic using python random funcitons, rather than PDE models.
I would like to try some other SIR models, but i found the lattice model a good intro, especially as I have some experience with Ising models etc. in physics. 
There is an interesting Machine leanring program that can identify affected olive tress via statilite, that would be an interesting combination with this papers work.
